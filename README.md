# Real estate article managment page

This project is first project that i'm realising with mysql and php together,
Basicly it's an managment view of publiched articles that have cards of articles,
search by min and max price and also type (rent or sale), the articles data are stored in mysql DB, 
there are 2 actions on cards which is edit and delete, and also the 4th actions in the website wich is
